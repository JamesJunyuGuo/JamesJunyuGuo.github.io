### Non-Stationary RL    
Usually we consider optimizing an objective under a stationary MDP with a fixed transition and reward function. We can learn the optimal policy through policy evaluation and policy improvement steps. However, in a constantly-changing environment where the transition kernal and the reward functions may be unkown, it's crucial for our learners to adapt itself to the environment through interaction and sampling.
