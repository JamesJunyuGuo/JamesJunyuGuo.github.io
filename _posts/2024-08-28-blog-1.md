This is my very first post, and I will share my view points about my life from now on. Today is the first day of the 24 Fall semester, it's nice to meet new people and walk around the campus. It's been long since I seriouly took courses as in the senior year as an undergrad the only course that I spent time learning was Functional Analysis lol, which of course I think was worth it. I always hold the point that, everyone, in the STEM field, for some point in their life, will inevitably have to seriously learn Functional Analysis. The finite-dim analysis seems so limited since whatever in functional class we need to learn or the space we are considering should at least be countably infinite to have some generalization properties. In this case the operator theory or the spectrum decomposition will be introduced to overcome the corresponding difficulties, which further emphasize the significance of FA.         

Sorry I might have diverged a little bit, let's move on. I mean the first day is great, taking the DP class by Javad, which may actually be a RL class actually. I think taking at least an advanced per semester is necessary, otherwise the course would be too easy to concentrate on. Anyway, it's just the first day, it's a nice start anyway!
