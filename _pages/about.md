I'm a senior undergraduate student from [Department of Mathematical Science](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interest includes data-driven sequential decision making, game theory, stochastic control and generating model.
During my undergraduate studies, I am been advised by [Prof. Chenxu Li](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/cxli/), [Prof. Yiwen Shen](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/yiwenshen) on Portfolio Allocation in Incomplete Market. I am also been a exchange student in Cornell University, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Andreea Minca](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/andreea-c-minca) and [Prof. Qiaomin Xie](https://qiaominxie.github.io/).
