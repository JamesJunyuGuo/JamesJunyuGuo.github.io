My name is Junyu Guo(James), and I am currently a Ph.D student at IEOR department of University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Prof. Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/index.html).    


Prior to arriving at Berkeley, I was a senior undergraduate student from [Department of Mathematical Science](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interest includes data-driven sequential decision making, game theory, stochastic control and generating model.
During my undergraduate studies, I am been advised by [Prof. Chenxu Li](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/cxli/), [Prof. Yiwen Shen](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/yiwenshen) on Portfolio Allocation in Incomplete Market. I am also been an exchange student in Cornell University, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Andreea Minca](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/andreea-c-minca) and [Prof. Qiaomin Xie](https://qiaominxie.github.io/).      

Now I am going to further my study through pursuing a Ph.D degree in IEOR.
