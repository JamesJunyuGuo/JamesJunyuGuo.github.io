My name is Junyu Guo(James), and I am currently a Ph.D student at IEOR department of University of California, Berkeley. In the coming days, I will be  advised by [Prof. Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/index.html).    




Prior to arriving at Berkeley, I was an undergraduate student in the  [Department of Mathematical Science of Tsinghua University](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China. My research interest includes data-driven sequential decision making, game theory, stochastic control and diffusion model.
During my undergraduate studies, I am been advised by [Prof. Chenxu Li](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/cxli/), [Prof. Yiwen Shen](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/yiwenshen) on Portfolio Allocation in Incomplete Market.       

I have also been an exchange student at Cornell University, where I was advised by [Prof. Andreea Minca](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/andreea-c-minca) and [Prof. Qiaomin Xie](https://qiaominxie.github.io/).     


During my leisure time, I love watching football game, playing football and cycling, and I am the fans of Manchester City and FC Barcelona.
