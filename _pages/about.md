## üìù About Me 

I am Junyu Guo (James), a Ph.D. student in the IEOR Department at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/index.html). My research focuses on designing efficient decision-making algorithms for agents operating under uncertainty, with particular emphasis on data-driven sequential decision-making for Large Language Models(LLMs). I am also fortunate to work with [Prof. Ming Jin](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/jinming.html) and [Dr. Shangding Gu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shangding.gu/index.html). 

Prior to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate studies in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tsinghua University](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China, where I was advised by [Prof. Chenxu Li](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/cxli/) and [Prof. Yiwen Shen](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/yiwenshen) on efficient simulation for portfolio allocation in incomplete markets.

During my time at Tsinghua, I was also an exchange student at Cornell University, collaborating with [Prof. Andreea Minca](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/andreea-c-minca) and [Prof. Qiaomin Xie](https://qiaominxie.github.io/) on reinforcement learning for mean field games.

Beyond research, I am an avid football fan (Manchester City and FC Barcelona), and I enjoy traveling, music, hiking, and playing soccer.

You can find my CV here: [Junyu's CV](../assets/CV_Junyu_Final.pdf).


## ü§ñ Research Interests

My current research focuses on:

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Designing efficient algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with emphasis on meta-RL for quick adaptation to non-stationary environments
- **Large Language Model Reasoning**: Improving LLM decision-making and reasoning capabilities through uncertainty estimation and quantification
- **Trustworthy AI**: Building AI systems that are interpretable, explainable, fair, and privacy-preserving
